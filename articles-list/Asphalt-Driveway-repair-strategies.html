                <p>Whether it’s a highway, road, or residential driveway, it’s critical to keep your asphalt driveway pavement in good condition. With increasing budget pressures, property and facility managers need to maximize the value of every maintenance investment. However, in many cases, maintenance work is more reactive than proactive in protecting the existing asphalt surface.Here are three main asphalt driveway repair strategies:</p>

                <h3>Preventive repair</h3>
                <p>Preventive maintenance is the most cost-effective way to extend the life of asphalt pavement. This strategy involves taking protective measures while the pavement is still in good condition, such as filling small cracks and applying seal coatings, to prevent small problems from becoming more serious damage.</p>

                <h3>Corrective repair</h3>
                <p>Repairs performed after the pavement has been damaged are usually corrective maintenance. This type of maintenance is more expensive, and common repair methods include structural covering, milling and resurfacing, pothole filling, crack sealing, rutting repair, and large crack treatment. Because corrective maintenance is usually performed after a problem occurs, it is also called "reactive maintenance."</p>
            
                <h3>Emergency repair</h3>
                <p>Emergency maintenance is for unexpected situations, such as severe potholes or tire blowout risks, to ensure the safety and usability of the road or parking lot. This type of maintenance involves temporary repairs to stabilize the damaged pavement until more permanent repairs can be implemented.</p>

                <p>Preventive, corrective, and emergency maintenance together make up a complete asphalt driveway pavement maintenance plan. Prioritizing preventive maintenance is the best strategy to avoid high repair costs. Our asphalt calculator can help you accurately calculate the tonnage and cost of asphalt driveway repairs, helping you develop an efficient pavement management plan to ensure that your pavement remains in high-quality condition for a long time.</p>
